Issues: I had the most trouble building the scanner and understanding how to parse valid inputs and when to throw errors. For the parser I had the most difficulty translating my grammar to code. I struggled to understand how the recursion worked to correctly evaluate expressions. 
Assumptions: I assumed that inputs such as " 1  2+6" should be treated as scanner errors.
